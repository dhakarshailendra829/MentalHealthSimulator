Believe in yourself. You are stronger than you think.
This too shall pass. Keep going.
You are not alone. Someone cares for you.
Every day is a second chance.
Your feelings are valid. Don't ignore them.
One small step at a time.
Healing is not linear, and that's okay.
Focus on what you can control.
You are doing the best you can — and that is enough.
Take a deep breath. You've got this.
Progress over perfection.
It’s okay to rest. You deserve it.
You have survived 100% of your bad days.
Storms make trees take deeper roots.
Let go of what you can't change. Focus on what you can.
